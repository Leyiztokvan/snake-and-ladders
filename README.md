# snake-and-ladders
This is an implementation of the Snakes & Ladders game.

### Testing Snakes & Ladders
*Test Driven Development* (TDD). 
In TDD, test cases are written in order to check whether a component behaves as expected. 
Good tests cover as much code as possible and use diverse method inputs. 
Complex methods should have multiple tests in order to cover all paths, and one should think of corner cases and special circumstances in which a method could be executed. 
The tests in this Snakes & Ladders game are written using JUnit and Mockito.
